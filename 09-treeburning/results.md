### Burning Trees

1. I chose a 150 sized board as it produced relatively continuous data, while still running in a reasonable amount of time.

2. After testing different possible numbers of iterations, I used 500 runs. This gave reasonable data and consistent data and ran in relatively little time.

3. Changing the board size changed the amount of ticks, but it did not change the shape of the data. The peak still occurred at approximately the same density, and the data had similar end behavior.

4. The board size did not seem to affect the density at which the maximum board size occurred, but did affect the number of ticks. I tested this by changing the board size, and manually analyzing the peaks.

5. The maximum ticks occurred at approximately 62%.
